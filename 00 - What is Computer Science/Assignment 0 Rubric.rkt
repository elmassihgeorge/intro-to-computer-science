; Welcome to Racket!

; "Comments" are lines of code that don't get executed -
; they're great for leaving notes like this in the margins!

; To make a single line comment, we use a semicolon like this

#|
We can also make multi line comments
if we want to include larger chunks of text
in our code. We do this by starting the block with
a pound sign and straight line (shift + back slash),
and end the chunk with a straight line then pound sign.

; Hello, my name is George

#|
+3 points for a basic definition
of computer science; the science
of programming computers, solving
problems, creating software etc.
|#

; Problem 3:
; In a multi-line comment, write who Alan Turing was and why he's important to computer science

#|
+3 points for some form
of saying that Alan Turing
is the father of modern
computer science.
|#

; Problem 4:
; In a multi-line comment, write why you're interested in computer science
; and one specific skill in programming you'd like to learn

#|
+3 points for any
response involving
why they want to learn
computer science and
what skill they want to learn.
